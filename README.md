# Harnessing-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Accurate-Predicting-Leptospira-Genus-Bacteria-Species

This repository hosts the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on the accurate classification of bacterial species within the *Leptospira* genus using genomic sequence data. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze One-Hot Encoded genomic segments, aiming to provide a robust predictive model for bioinformatics and genomic taxonomy.

The methodology encompasses a complete pipeline from raw genomic data processing, through feature engineering (One-Hot Encoding and sequence fragmentation), model development and hyperparameter optimization, to rigorous performance evaluation and visualization.
